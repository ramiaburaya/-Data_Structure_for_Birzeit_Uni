#  Data Structure for Birzeit University

• Developed a program that simulates an efficient data structure for managing student data at Birzeit
University as a practice in data structures.

• Implemented basic operations such as adding, deleting, searching, and displaying information for students.

• Built AVL tree and Hash Table data structures from scratch and utilized them to improve the program's
performance and functionality.

• This project helped me to enhance my understanding of data structures and how to implement them in real-world applications.
