#  Data Structure for Birzeit University

This project aims to build a sample departments file that contains department information records in the following format: Department name / Department_related_data_file_name (e.g. Computer Science / Computer_Science.txt ).

Step 1: Create a sample departments file with the specified format.

Step 2: Using the data file created in step 1, build an AVL tree of Department nodes with the department name as the key.

Step 3: Implement the following functions on the AVL tree:

Print out departments sorted.
Search for a specific department.
Insert a new department.
Delete a specific department.
Calculate tree height.
Step 4: Using the Department_related_date_file_name that is stored in each tree department node, load the student data that is stored in each file. The student record data format in these files is as follows: Student_full_name /Student_ID/ Average/Gender (e.g. Ahmad Ali/12000199 /85.4/M).

Step 5: Create a Hash Table using the student data from step 4 (Key: Student_full_name). Implement the following functions on the student hash table:

Print hashed table (including empty spots).
Print out table size.
Print out used hash function.
Insert a new record to hash table.
Search for a specific record.
Delete a specific record.
Save hash table back to file.
